In a counter-attack to comment by one of his critics, Joe Igbokwe, Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on drainages, on Friday, said Bola Tinubu will remain Nigeria’s president until 2031 and thereafter, handover power to a northerner who will rule the country till 2039. Igbokwe made the submission while reacting to a comment on his Facebook post. The APC chieftain had made a post on his Facebook handle justifying while Igbos residing in Lagos should support the re-election of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu who is seeking his second term. “President-Elect ASIWAJU BAT is a good friend of the Igbo and he did his best for prominent Igbo business men and women in Lagos including me. This is payback time and we should do this by voting for GOV SANWO OLU en mass on March 18,” Igbokwe wrote on his timeline. This, however, did not sit well with some of his followers who took a swipe at the Sanwo-Olu’s aide. A follower with the username Ejike Akunna, in reaction, stormed the comment section to ridicule the APC chieftain. “Dash him your wife and daughters and enthrone him as your family deity. That’ll be adequate payback,” Ejike wrote. Angered by Ejike’s comment, Igbokwe declared that despite anger and hatred being meted at Tinubu by critics, the latter would rule the country for eight years and hand over to a northerner, ruling out the possibility of Igbo presidency. “When I see the level of despicable abuses and calling of names coming from the South East young people I run away with the thinking that we Diderot not do our duties as parents. “Shame has enveloped me from head to toe. Ejike Akunna jisieike. But mark my words here: Asiwaju from 2023 to 2031 and another Northerner from 2031 to 2039. “We will still be children of anger and children of hate and life goes on. We will be onlookers because we refused to play politics. Dazzol!” He replied.    READ ALSO FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
