Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has revealed how the G5 Governors aka Integrity Group supported the candidates of the Labour Party (LP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), Peter Obi and Bola Tinubu, respectively in the Saturday, February 25 presidential election. Wike, who spoke at the commissioning of Akpabu-Egbeda road in the Emohua Local Government Area (APC), on Friday, said the G5 Governors agreed to support the duo as a result of Southern Presidency. According to him, the support for a southern president had nothing to do with political parties but the unity and oneness of Nigeria. His words; “I never campaigned against Obi. I never did that. Is not that he (Obi) will do me anything, wetin he go do me? He can’t do me anything. But I felt is of no need since we (G5 Governors) are talking of Southern Presidency. “We (Intregity Group) agreed that we will make sure that power comes to the South and that in any State where you have control, if Labour Party comes first, APC must come second and vise-versa. And we did it!” He also commended the APC Governors for standing firm to support the Southern Presidency adding that he won’t be running for president again. “I commend them (APC), so whether you voted for (Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter) Obi or you voted for Asiwaju (Tinubu), I have no problem with you, as far as you stood for the southern presidency,” he added. Recall Bola Tinubu was declared the winner of the presidential election on March 1, while PDP and LP presidential candidates, Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi came second and third respectively. The Rivers governor, a member of the PDP, had refused to support Atiku’s campaign, saying the party’s constitution was against one region of the country producing both the presidential candidate and the national chairman.
