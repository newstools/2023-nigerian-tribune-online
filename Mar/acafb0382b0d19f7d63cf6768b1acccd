Ebenezer Adurokiya – Warri Former Secretary to the Delta State Government, Comrade Ovuozourie Macaulay, says the glory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the State has departed. Recall the veteran journalist dumped the ruling PDP just recently saying the party had outlived its usefulness in the State. The former Director General of Warri Uvwie and Environs Development Agency (WUEDA) made the assertion when he led scores of his followers across Isoko nation to the All Progressives Congress (APC) at Owhelogbo, Isoko North Local Government Area of the State. They were welcomed into the party by APC state chairman, Omene Sobotie, and the governorship candidate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege as well as his deputy. Speaking further, Chief Macaulay, who’s the Okiroro of Isoko Nation, said that, “The results of the last election in Delta State shows that PDP has lost it glory. “An election where a leading party with a seating governor produced one Senator while the opposition produced two Senators shows that PDP has lost its glory in Delta.” The former chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Delta State Council, hinted on why he jumped ship. “I left PDP because I could no longer bear the oppression and injustice I was subjected to. “When it comes to the stage where you are subjected to take instructions from your subordinate, it is the height of insults and I am not ready for that anymore. “I have endured enough, complained enough and I feel I should leave the party for them,” the former chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Delta, noted.
