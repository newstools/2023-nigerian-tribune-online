Rachael Omidiji The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has said that he is ready to form an alliance with the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi. He stated this on Thursday, 2nd March 2023, during a press conference in Abuja. Atiku said, “So, as far as I am concerned, Peter is welcome to dialogue with the PDP. We are ready to dialogue with him. I don’t think we will have a problem if he wants to dialogue with the PDP, whether for an alliance or not.” Obi, a former PDP chieftain, left the party before the presidential primary and joined the LP, where he became the presidential candidate. However, Atiku faulted Obi’s move, which he said was “hasty” and poorly thought out. Atiku said, “So, for anybody to think that I have anything against Labour Party, I think Peter (Obi) was in a rush. Do you know why I say he was in a rush? When the campaign and our PDP governors sat down and said they must produce the next President, vice president, and Chief of Staff amongst them, Peter got scared and left. I did not get scared. I stood up against the governors, and I fought them and won the primaries,so if he was there, nothing could have stopped him from becoming a running mate.”
