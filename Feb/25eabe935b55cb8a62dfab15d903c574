PRESIDENTIAL candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu; vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr Ifeanyi Okowa and the governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, bowed to the superior political power of Peter Obi-led Labour Party (LP) in their respective states. Obi also swept Plateau and Nasarawa states, performed creditably in Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Taraba and some others. The LP candidate topped the presidential election chat in Lagos State with 582,442 votes with the APC trailing with 576,606 votes.

The victory wave of the party hit Delta State with Okowa losing in his bid to win the state for the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.
