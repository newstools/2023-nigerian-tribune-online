There was gridlock along the busy Asaba/Onitsha expressway  on Wednesday as angry youths, rights activists and motorists, protested in Asaba, over the high fuel prices and hoarding  of  new naira notes by banks. Armed with placards, the protesters drummed for a better Nigeria and called on the authorities to intervene by reducing the  cost of living for the citizens of the country. The protesters led by a candidate  for the house of representatives in the forthcoming election from Ethiope,  Comrade Ukuanovwe, Odimbu demanded sanction for bank managers in the state for hoarding the new naira notes. They called on President Muhammadu Buhari and Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa to prevail on the fuel marketers and filling station operators to reduce the cost of fuel per litre. The protesters vowed to continue the protest until the  two issues are addressed.
