National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) has disclosed that no fewer than about 380 people were killed and 71 others abducted in Niger State between 2015 and 2021. The record also revealed that an amount not less than N79 million has been paid as ransom to bandits in the state in the same period. This was handed down by the North-Central coordinator of the centre, Maj. Gen. Hassan Ibrahim Bature (retd) at a sensitisation Programme for the newly posted National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members to the State at the NYSC’s permanent  orientation camp in Paiko, the headquarters of Paikoro LGA of the state. The Coordinator, represented by the Assistant Director, Intelligence, Lt. Col. DV Gimba, also noted that out of the 25 local government areas of the state, 18 have been attacked by bandits since 2015 with Shiroro, Munya, Rafi, Mashegu, and recently, Lapai local government areas  as worst hit (invaded) and overrun by bandits. He stated further that 380 people were killed and 71 others were  abducted even as farmer-herder conflicts occurred 71 times, accounting for several injuries and deaths in the north-central zone. “Insecurity persists in Nigeria because there are many illicit weapons in the hands of people. However, there’s a need to stop the spread and restore peace and development,” he said He said the North-Central geopolitical zone remained a hotbed for farmer-herder conflicts with 58 percent occurrences and 61 percent casualties adding that the security threats were directly linked to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In the United Nations (UN) report, he noted that  Nigeria accounted for 350 million or 70 percent of an estimated 500 million illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons circulating in West Africa.
