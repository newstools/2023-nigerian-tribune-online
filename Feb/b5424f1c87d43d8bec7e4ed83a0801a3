A leader of Ndi Igbo in Lagos and Special Adviser for Drainage and Water Resources to Lagos State Governor, Joe Igbokwe has beseeched the Igbo people in the state to vote massively for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Candidate, Bola Tinubu in the upcoming election as a payback time for the good deeds done for them. Igbokwe stated this during the endorsement ceremony of the APC Presidential candidate and Lagos State gubernatorial candidate at the Governor’s Campaign Office on saturday in Lagos. Igbokwe said that the investments and businesses the igbos have in lagos cannot be found anywhere else, saying it is as a result of the gate that Asiwaju opened to them. According to him, Tinubu does not know East, West and North and he is not a candidate of Southwest but that of Nigeria. He noted that the kind of structure Tinubu has across Nigeria shows “he is the man to beat”. READ ALSO FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
