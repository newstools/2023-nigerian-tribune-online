A Sharia Court in Magajin  Gari, Kaduna, Kaduna State has dissolved the union between Muhammad Abdulganiyu and Ma’arufat Ibrahim. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the judge, Malam Rilwan Kyaudai, delivering judgment said their marriage was dissolved after all efforts to reconcile them by the court and their guardians failed. He ordered Ma’arufat to return N20,000 paid as dowry. “She will also return the marriage suitcases she received and their contents with the exception of the ones she has already sewn. “She will not return the cell phone as requested by the complainant, but she will return the silver rings she received from him,” he held. Earlier, Muhammad Abdulganiyu in his petition alleged that his wife left their matrimonial home without any altercation. “I tried my best to provide for her, but she and her mother do not appreciate my efforts and we’ve been married barely three months. “If she’s no longer interested in our marriage, she should pay me all I spent during the wedding and return the phone and silver rings I gave her,” he said. On her part, the defendant said she left because her husband does not provide food for her. She said that he had told her that his mother pushed him into marrying her.
