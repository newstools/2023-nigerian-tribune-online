The National Population Commission (NPC) has outlined the salary and allowances structure for its ad hoc staff who will be involved in the conduct of the 2023 Population and Housing Census. The remuneration is divided into two categories – allowances and main salary. In the category of allowances, according to the Director of Census Department, Mrs Evelyn Arinola Olanipekun, the NPC ad hoc staff will receive three types of allowances, namely; feeding allowance: (a) Specialised Workforce (SWF) – N2,000 per day x 13 days (three days of SWF and 10 days of state training). However, states that did not observe the first three days are exempted. Total N26,000. (b) State Facilitators: N2,000 per person, per day x 10 days. Total: N20,000 For the transport allowance it is N20,000 per person. Training allowance: (a) Trainer: N15,000 per day x 13 (SWF) and 10 (state facilitator) (b) Trainee: N10,000 per day x 13 (SWF) and 10 (state facilitator). The commission said payment will be made twice for all categories, as follows: transport and feeding: N46,000 (SWF), N40,000 (state facilitators). Training allowance: trainer (SWF) – N195,000; trainee – N130,000; state trainers (facilitators) -N150, 000; trainees – 100,000. It added that the above allowances would also apply to other categories such as enumerators and supervisors, but with a shorter number of training days and a slight reduction in the amount. On average, the total allowances for specialised workforce, facilitators, enumerators, supervisors, and other census functionaries range from N50,000 to N100,000. NPC said that the main salary for NPC ad hoc staff will be paid after the completion of the census exercise. The average basic or main salary for each census functionary ranges from N50,000 to N250,000, depending on the position. It summarised the salary and allowances for NPC ad hoc staff during the 2023 Population and Housing Census as follows: facilitators – N150,000 to N300,000; field coordinator – N140,000 to N280,000; quality assurance assistants/rovers – N130,000 to N280,000; supervisor – N130,000 to N230,000; enumerator – N100,000 to N220,000; monitoring and evaluation officer – N150,000 to N300,000.
