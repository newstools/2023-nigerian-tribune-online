Canvassing for the Peoples Democratic Party, ( PDP) in the February 25 election, Prince Nwoko stressed the need to have a cohesive team to rescue, rebuilt and reset Nigeria from the onslaught done to the country by the APC-led federal government. He promised to tap his legislative experience as a  former member of the House of Representatives,  representing the Aniocha/Oshimili Federal Constituency to give Delta North an effective representation that would impact positively the people of the zone. He appealed to the people of Anioma (Delta north) and indeed Nigerians to vote massively for PDP candidates at all levels just to end the suffering in the country. ALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
