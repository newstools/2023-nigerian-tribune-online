The Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu made this known in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report. Nwachukwu said the hotlines were to afford members of the public, the opportunity to support efforts of security agencies in ensuring peaceful elections across the country. He said the hotlines were also released to report the conduct of troops deployed to provide security during the election.
