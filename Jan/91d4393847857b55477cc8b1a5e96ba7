Embattled Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike on Thursday, says his Oyo counterpart, Seyi Makinde would inform the people of the State of their preferred presidential candidate ahead of the February 25 poll. The arrowhead of the G5 Governors popularly called Integrity Group disclosed this during the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rally in Ibadan, Oyo state capital. The PDP G5 governors – Wike, Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), and Samuel Ortom (Benue) have been at loggerheads with the party and its presidential candidate, Atiku, insisting that they will not support him unless the party’s Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu is removed. Wike believed Seyi Makinde is arguably the only credible candidate in the race urging the electorates to vote the Oyo governor for second term.
