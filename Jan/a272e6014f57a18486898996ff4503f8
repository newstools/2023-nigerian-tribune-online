The authorities of the Lagos State University (LASU) Ojo have instructed all its lecturers to ensure they don’t allow any student who dresses indecently into the classrooms. The university in a statement by the acting head of Centre for Information, Press and Public Relations, Mr Olaniyi Jeariogbe said the vice-chancellor of the university, Prof. Ibiyemi Olatunji-Bello, is no longer comfortable with the continuous disregard by students for the university’s extant rules and regulations on students’ modes of dressing on campus. He said the vice-chancellor in this regard had informed the college provost, deans of faculties and heads of departments, as well as faculty officers at both the main and satellite campuses to join hands with the lecturers to enforce the dressing rules. The university listed 15 dressing patterns that the management considered indecent for students to do away with them, particularly on campus.
