The NLC chairman in the  State Comrade Idris Lakpene handed down the warning during an interview with the newsmen  in Minna, just as he expressed dismay  at a situation where a citizen of this country would fail  to take his/ her Civic duty/  responsibility serious. Comrade  Lakpene thereby  charged  workers in the state to fully participate in politics, stressing  that PVCs  would enable them to elect leaders that can better their working conditions and to bring meaningful development to the state. He further explained that any Civil servants in the state who deliberately refused to collect  his Personal Voter’s Card (PVC) shall have his salary stopped or faced suspension as another way of punishment. In a similar vein  , the Chairman of the State chapter of the  Nigeria Youth Council, Comrade  Abdullahi Muhammad Ishaq Kuta has called on the Youths in the state to ensure that they collect their PVCs as this year’s general elections in the country draw nearer.
