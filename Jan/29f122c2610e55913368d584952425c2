Nigeria’s foremost elder statesman, Ibrahim Babangida has refuted claims that he endorsed Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for the 2023 general elections. In a recent tweet by a parody account (General_Ibbro), the former Military Head of State was quoted to have supported the endorsement of Obi by former president Olusegun Obasanjo. “Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo will forever be a true elder statesman and a boss in the military. No serving General in the Nigerian Army today joined the military earlier than 1982. By then, Obasanjo had already finished his military career. I respect him a lot, with his endorsement,” the tweet reads. Gen.
