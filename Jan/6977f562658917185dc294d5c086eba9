Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, in his effort to ensure that the state indigenes studying abroad were not sent back home over non-payment of school fees has paid N18 billion in scholarships for a number of students studying abroad. Disclosing this on Monday, Comrade Muhammad Garba, the state Commissioner for Information and culture in an interactive conference said that most of the affected students were based in France, Cyprus, and Egypt. According to him, “previous government sent students abroad on courses that are available, and cheaper here but the state government could do anything contrary than to offset the payment”. He however disclosed that the state government has no quarrel with those on specialised courses that are not available here adding that it is out of place to sponsor a set of students to read History abroad.

We agreed on instalments payment, and so far we have paid €600m,“ he said.
