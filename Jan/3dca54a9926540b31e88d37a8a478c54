Maize farmers in Katsina State are currently battling terrorist attack which has seen many sacked from their farms and many farmlands remained inaccessible because of the presence of terrorists. This is just as farmers across North-West experienced a low yield of maize in 2022 despite the efforts of the government through the Anchor Borrowers Program (ABP) implemented by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Speaking exclusively with Nigeria Tribune, the Chairman of Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN), Katsina State, Lawal Garba, said real farmers benefited from the ABP in Katsina State but they are faced with a series of problems such as insecurity, drought, and insect infestation. He said over 470 farmers have been killed in the past 3 years, while many have abandoned their farms for terrorists and relocated to the major cities to seek refuge.
