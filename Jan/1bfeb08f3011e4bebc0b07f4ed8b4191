Reverend Father Ejike Mbaka, the Spiritual Director of the Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), has urged Nigerian doctors in search of greener pastures abroad to be ready to come back home, as the country is going to be well. Mbaka, in a recent sermon at the church’s prayer ground monitored by TRIBUNE ONLINE, decried the influx of Nigerian doctors migrating to overseas. Addressing the congregation, he asked; “If you are given American visa today, how many of you will leave Nigeria?” To his amazement, a large percentage of the members raised their hands in unison. He then replied; “If all of you (addressing the congregants) will go out, how many will remain?” ALSO READ: JAPA: Stay in Nigeria to restore its lost glory, Oyedepo tells Nigerian youths “It’s going to be well.
