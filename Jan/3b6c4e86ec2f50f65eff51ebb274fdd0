A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Monday dismissed a suit by a former presidential candidate of the Hope Democratic Party (HDP), Chief Ambrose Albert Owuru against the election of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 presidential election. The suit seeking outright sack of President Buhari was thrown out by Justice Inyang Ekwo on three major grounds. Parts of the grounds are that the suit constituted a gross abuse of court process, statute barred and was an affront to the Supremacy of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.

Owuru had in the suit applied for an order of court to declare the presidential seat vacant and swear him in as the authentic winner of that election.
