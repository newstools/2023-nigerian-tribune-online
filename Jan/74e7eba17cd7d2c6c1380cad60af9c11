One of the opposition political parties, New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) has now emerged as the minority party in Gombe State House of Assembly taking it over from the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The development is as a result of the defection of the member representing Kaltungo West constituency, Hon Bashir Yakubu Barau from the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) who joined the NNPP. He was received into the NNPP by the Gombe State Governorship candidate of the party, Khamisu Ahmad Mailantarki. Before his defection, the PDP and NNPP both had three seats each in the Gombe State House of Assembly but, with his defection, the NNPP now has four seats and will consequently produce the minority caucus in the House. According to the lawmaker, he took the decision to join NNPP in the best interest of the state, adding that both APC and PDP lack the requisite leadership qualities to unite and develop the state.
