A young Nigerian doctor on Twitter identified as @the_beardedsina has advised women who wished for twins to visit Igboora in Oyo and eat their ‘special yam’. The advice comes on the heels of a woman who earlier tweeted that she desired to give birth to twins. Reacting, the doctor claimed the Igboora yam contains clomiphene which stimulates the ovaries in women to produce twins.
