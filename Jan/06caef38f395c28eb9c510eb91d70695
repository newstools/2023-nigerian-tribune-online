On this day, I celebrate the day I came to this world This day, family, friends, and colleagues rejoice With me Do they not know a year older means a year closer to the grave? Do they not see my grey hair? Do they not see the frailty in my steps? Do they not see that I cannot read without a microscope? Do they not see I am bound to nullity?  Plaques, trophies, accolades sing of my accomplishments They cover my walls as clouds adorn the sky. Children and coming generations may fill my house  But, With every new age, I attain I am transitioning into nothingness  I have savoured the sweet, the bitter, and the sour of life I have been called great, and I have sat with the greats But, I am inch-by-inch, moment-by-momentagbalagba Daintily transitioning into nothingnessâ€¦
