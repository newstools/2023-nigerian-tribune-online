Barely a week after former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s endorsement of Peter Obi, founder and Chancellor of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Afe Babalola (SAN) has said the Labour Party flag-bearer is the most qualified candidate to lead Nigeria.

According to him, the only people opposed to Obi are those who participated in plunging the country into the state of underdevelopment it is at present. “Unless you are part of the old system that has brought us to where we are, there is no way you will oppose a young man like Mr Peter Obi, an untainted, young, educated man with ideas from being the president of Nigeria,” he said. The cerebral lawyer said he shares a similar attribute with Obi based on their passion for education.
