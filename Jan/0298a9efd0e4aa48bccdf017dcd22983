Operatives of the Plateau State Police Command have rescued a traditional ruler of Agwom Izere, Dr Azi Waziri, who was kidnapped in the early hours of Friday, while two of the suspected abductors were arrested. The State Police Command, in a statement signed by its spokesman, DSP Alfred Alabo, confirmed the rescue of the paramount ruler and the arrest of two of the kidnappers. According to the statement, the police received a distressed call from the Angware Police Divisional Headquarters of the Command that unknown gunmen had forcefully entered the residence of Agwom Izare, HRH.
