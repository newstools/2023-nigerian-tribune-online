Human rights lawyer and former chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Professor Chidi Odinkalu has said Peter Obi, the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate does damage to both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the February 25 poll. Prof Odinkalu in a recent interview with Nigerian Tribune said the LP flag-bearer is a factor in the election adding that this year’s election will be slightly different and unique. “Peter Obi, of course, does damage. But Obi is an equal opportunity damage. “Obi is going to cost PDP votes in the South-East, but he is also a factor in Lagos and nobody is claiming that PDP is likely to win Lagos  because it is Tinubu’s home state and Tinubu is likely to win Lagos.

That is just what it is in this election.” Discover Effective Natural Solution That Permanently Eradicate Hepatitis B&C, Fatty liver etc. Newly Improved organic Solution to Cure Every Liver Related Diseases.
