I write this open letter to our amiable Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, to kindly look into the case of the unpaid benefits of my late wife, Mrs Margaret Kikelomo Olu-Olaniran, who died in active service as a principal, St David’s Junior School, Kudeti, Ibadan, in 2014 at the age of 59, barely one year to her retirement. As the husband and next of kin to the deceased, I have submitted all necessary documents to the Ministry of Establishment since February 24, 2016. All efforts so far to collect the outstanding gratuity has yielded no fruitful results. At 70, I feel so unhappy that nothing has been done on the issue even after writing a letter through the office of the Head of Service to the governor in the year 2020. I have reached out to the governor’s office through WhatsApp, but the only message I got from the governor’s special assistant on news media was that I should present evidence of illness in order to be considered on compassionate grounds. Even as I write, one of my late wife’s relations, who is one of those to benefit from the gratuity, is down with a terminal illness but there is no money to take her to hospital for treatment. I plead with Engineer Makinde to look into this issue as you has been good to retirees in Oyo State. God bless you sir. Olaniran Oluyinka, 08033683466.  ALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE
