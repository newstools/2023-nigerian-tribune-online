The yellow ball of the sky sits on the clouds, watching mortal affairs Some say the sun has blessed their day when it shines Others complain it is too harsh It retreats and goes home into the skies after its job is done. The silvery pageant of the night; a soft glare on beings of the night The glow of the moon casts an illumination for the nightcrawlers Some will say its light is not enough for their sight After the night shift, it disappears into the clouds.  Fiery red fire  Cooks great meals for all and sundry; even burns rubbish Some only point to its ability to burn, hurt, and ruin When the job is done, quietly, fire leaves ashes in its wake.
