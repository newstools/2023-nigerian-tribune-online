The suspended assistant superintendent of police, Drambi Vandi has pleaded not guilty to the murder of lagos-based female lawyer Raheem Bolanle. The suspended cop was arraigned on one count of murder before the Lagos State High Court, Tafawa Balewa Square annex, on Monday. After the charge sheet was read to him, Vandi pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. Raheem was allegedly shot dead by Vandi in the Ajah area of Lagos on Christmas Day. She was returning home from an outing with her family when she was shot. Raheemâ€™s death generated widespread criticism from many persons and groups in the country, as they condemned what they described as extrajudicial killing, linking it the incident as one of such reasons for the nationwide #EndSARS protest of 2020. Vandi was arrested and appeared before Chief Magistrate C.A. Adedayo on December 30, 2022, a day after the Police Service Commission approved his suspension.
