In less than 42 days to the 2023 general elections, Prof ABC Nwosu, a former Minister of Health cum Board of Trustees (BoT), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dumped the party. This comes on the heels of the internal wrangling rocking the part following the fallout of its presidential primary that saw former Vice President Abubakar Atiku emerging as the party’s flag-bearer. According to Prof Nwosu, he won’t join another political party as he is almost 80 years of age saying he won’t be in a hurry to make his next political decision.
