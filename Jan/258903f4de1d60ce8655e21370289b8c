The Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Organisation has told the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, to leave it out of any problems he may have with President Muhammadu Buhari, which the campaign noted, resulted in his continued attack and vitriolic on the President. In a statement issued, on Thursday, Kola Ologbondiyan, spokesperson of the campaign, maintained that it found it pathetic that less than 24 hours after Tinubu stood on the public stage at his presidential rally in Abeokuta, Ogun State, to accuse the Buhari administration of creating fuel scarcity and redesigning the naira to scuttle the 2023 election, he had turned around to blame the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for his woes. The statement observed that it is strange that Tinubu now wanted the world to believe that his caustic remarks against Buhari were intended for Atiku Abubakar and the PDP when neither Atiku nor PDP is involved in the monetary policies or the failure to arrest the horrifically unending fuel crisis. It added: “It is important to remind Asiwaju Tinubu that in accusing the ‘powers that be’ of creating fuel scarcity and hoarding the naira to truncate the election, he knew that President Buhari is the Minister of Petroleum Resources and that all agencies of government in charge of prospecting and distribution of petroleum resources are under his (Buhari) office. “Asiwaju also knew that President Buhari approved the redesigning of the naira and that issues of distribution of the naira notes are vested in the APC-controlled Federal Government and not in the PDP. “It is therefore clear that Asiwaju’s verbal assaults against President Buhari is the official position of his confused, disoriented and disorganized Campaign Organization.

The list is endless! “Asiwaju Tinubu’s politics had always been about “self and the cabal” who never cared for Nigerians or the success of the government he claimed to have brought to power. “He should therefore leave the PDP and its Presidential Candidate, Atiku Abubakar alone and face his self-inflicted woes. “On our side, the Atiku/Okowa Campaign will not be distracted by Asiwaju Tinubu but will continue to focus on rallying with Nigerians in their determination to vote in Atiku Abubakar as the next President of Nigeria so that he can commence the onerous task of rebuilding our nation from the misrule of the APC.”
