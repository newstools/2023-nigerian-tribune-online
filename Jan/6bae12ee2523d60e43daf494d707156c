But with the concessioning of 19 silos by the Nigerian Government in 2019, the country is expected to earn N18 billion. According to the Director of Food and Strategic Reserve at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Engr Haruna Suleman, the government concessioned the storage space to the private sector, to enable farmers to have access to storage facilities. Engr Suleman said this effort by the government was to reduce post-harvest losses which farmers especially those in the rural areas suffer year round. “In addressing these problems, the federal government has been able to lease out the silos to the private sector, and we have been able to establish grain aggregation centres that will be able to clean, dry and bag products. This lease agreement of silos to private sectors will attract N18 billion to Nigeria”, he stated.
