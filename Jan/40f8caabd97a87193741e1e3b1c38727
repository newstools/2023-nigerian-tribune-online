The Senate confirmed President Muhammadu Buhari’s nomination of Mr Solomon Arase as Chairman Police Service Commission (PSC) at the plenary on Wednesday. Arase’s confirmation was sequel to the consideration of a report by the Committee on Police Affairs. Sen Jika Halliru, Chairman of the Committee (APC-Bauchi), presented the report. Haillu said Arase’ nomination followed section 154, sub-section 1 of the 1999 constitution. According to him, sections two A and B of the Police Service Commission Establishment Act 2001 also required the President to nominate Nigerians of proven integrity as members of the PSC. He added that Arase meets the legal requirements to be the proper person to be appointed as Chairman of PSC.
