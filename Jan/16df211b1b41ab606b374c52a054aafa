The people of Ogun have been told to expect more infrastructural developments across the length and breadth of the state. The assurance was given by Governor Dapo Abiodun, on Friday, while addressing the people of Ijebu North Local Government Area of the state, in continuation of his re-election campaign to the council area. He urged the people to be patient with his administration, saying that areas yet to feel the impact of his administration will soon begin to enjoy infrastructure developments.

He said: “This will be the third time we will be in this local government to commission road projects. We were here to commission the Igan road in Ago-Iwoye. About five weeks ago, we were at Ijebu-Igbo to commission the Molusi College Road and today we are here to commission the Oru-Awa-Alaporu road. “This local government area is indeed lucky to have three projects in less than four years. You can recall that this local government did not benefit from any project from the past government, but now you have three,” he said.
