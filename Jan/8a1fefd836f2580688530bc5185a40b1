Prince Walson, a.k.a. Mr. Sab, an Afrobeats singer and songwriter, has declared that he will not obstruct his children if they choose to pursue careers in music. “Music thrives in my family, and I wouldn’t be surprised if all my children acquired an interest in music,” he claimed. The musician also mentioned that he has been able to juggle both making music and finding time for his family. The singer also said that though his career in music did not get off to an easy start, he was able to persevere when everything else failed because of his perseverance and passion for the work. “My passion for music and other entertainment endeavours has always been strong. In addition to music, I am a businessman who is aware that being relevant requires ongoing excellence. Nothing else could have kept this brand alive without the presence of God in my life, thus I am thankful for God’s mercy to  me.”
