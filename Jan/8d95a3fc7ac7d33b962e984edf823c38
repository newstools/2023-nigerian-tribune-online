Throughout the month of January, people continue the festivities in various forms and it is common for family and friends to get together for weekends to return visits from people that celebrated with them during the festivities.

And as a result, food items are left out for long periods and this may give opportunity for harmful bacteria to enter the food. Also, there is usually so much leftovers at such events and such leftovers can be salvaged because food should not be allowed to become waste in this economy.
