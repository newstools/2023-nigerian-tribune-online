Chief Dele Momodu, the spokesperson of Peoples Democratic Party’s Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign has said the defeat of the APC flag-bearer, Bola Tinubu in the February 25 poll is imminent. Momodu, in an exclusive interview with Nigerian Tribune, described the former Lagos governor as someone who is surrounded by negativity adding that he is not aware that Tinubu has ever been investigated in Nigeria with all the horrendous things and stories about him. “The reason they’re doing it (attacking Atiku), they can see; next month is the election and Tinubu is going to lose the election. “So, they have to grab at every straw, at everything they can get to attack Atiku Abubakar but trust me, the man has become a porcupine. “When people have beaten you and beaten you over time, you turn into a porcupine and nothing can touch you again,” he said.
