It was reported that my ex allegedly concocted these lies. “For the record, I am not a violent person. I have not had to exchange punches with anyone and I was never violent in the marriage. “The most painful part of the report is that they said I used to beat my mother. This is not only a personal attack, it is satanic. It is against everything I stand for and believe. As a properly raised Yoruba lady, it is costly to lay your hands on your parent. “As a matter of fact, my mum has been late for over 20 years. And I never raised my hands against my mother-in-law. It never happened, and it will never happen. My family members, my ex’s family members, and our neighbours can testify to that. “I wish those who started the rumour and those spreading well and pray that God rewards every one of us according to the works of our hands.  “As for me, I am focused on the next level, and I have moved on from the past. I advise everyone else to do the same.”   A post shared by QUEEN LATEEFAH (@wumitoriola)
