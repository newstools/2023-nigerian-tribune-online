Plateau State Police Command has arrested one Pastor Albarka Bitrus Sukuya for organising his kidnapping along with his cohorts and receiving ransom from sympathizing members of his congregation. In a statement signed by its spokesperson, DSP Alfred Alabo, the Command pointed out that the clergyman who lives at Jenta Apata in Jos North local government area of the State had on several occasions staged his kidnapping and as well carried out other atrocities. It mentioned that his atrocities triggered suspicion as a result of his spurious kidnapping on November 14 and 30, 2022, where the sums of N400,000 and N200,000 were respectively paid by his sympathisers as ransom for his release. “Through credible intelligence, the clergyman was invited by the DPO of Nassarawa Gwong Police Station, CSP Musa Hassan, and the investigation commenced immediately.
