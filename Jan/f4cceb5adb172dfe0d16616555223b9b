Ahead of the 2023 governorship election in Delta State, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC),
Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has challenged the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, to a debate on a national television. Omo-Agege, who’s the Deputy President of the Senate, lambasted Oborevwori for hiding behind his political godfather and vice presidential candidate of the PDP, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, in his campaigns. He charged Deltans to pressurised the PDP governorship candidate to personally speak to them in an open debate to be aired nationally. He also challenged Oborevwori to tell Deltans what he has done as the longest serving Speaker and what he will do as a governor if elected into office in 2023. The Delta Central lawmaker spoke on Monday at Orerokpe, Aghalokpe and Adeje towns in continuation of the APC ward-to-ward campaign train to Okpe Local Government Area of the state. The senator further berated Oborevwori for failing to use his influence as the speaker to ensure the completion of the Effurun-Orerokpe-Eku dualisation project in his immediate constituency.
