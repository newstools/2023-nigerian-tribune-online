President Muhammadu Buhari who was in Bauchi state for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign could not address the mammoth crowd that gathered at the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Memorial stadium due to technical hiccup. The President and the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu as well as the National Chairman of the APC mounted the podium to speak but the sound system went off, all efforts to restore it proved abortive. After waiting for about 10 minutes and the technical crew could not rectify the problem, President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu presented the flag to the gubernatorial candidate of the APC in Bauchi State, Amb Saddique Baba Abubakar.
