He pointed out that all the campaign efforts made until this time would be useless if the supporters do not have their PVC to make a statement at the polls. “This is a critical and existential election for Nigeria and all of us must endeavor to vote and we can only vote if we have our PVC. “PVC must be collected because it’s only with it in our hands, that the process of taking back Nigeria and rebuilding it can be said to have begun,” Obi said.
