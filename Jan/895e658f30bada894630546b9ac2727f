Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has given the paramount traditional ruler and Ohinoyi of Ebiraland, Dr. Ado Ibrahim 48 hours ultimatum to reply to his query following the latter’s refusal to welcome President Muhammadu Buhari to the State. Recall Buhari was in the State on December 29, 2022, to inaugurate some projects built by the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello. It was gathered the palace of the Ohinoyi of Ebiraland was rocked by explosions on the inauguration day, resulting in the death of three people and several others injured. In a letter signed by Director of Chieftaincy Affairs, Enimola Eniola which was obtained by Tribune Online Friday, the governor accused the first-class monarch of exhibiting a deliberate attitude and actions capable of bringing “Kogi State and Ebira land in particular to grave disrepute”.
