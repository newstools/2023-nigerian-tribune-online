The United Kingdom Chapter of the Labour Party has debunked the dissolution of its executives under the leadership of Chief Daniel Matthew-led administration saying it is “fake news”. A report had claimed the Matthew-led excos has been dissolved by the National Chairman, Dr Julius Abure. The General Secretary of the chapter, Dr Valerie Mbongo in a statement sighted by Tribune Online, urged the party members to discard the malicious rumours and focus on the task at hand, which according to her, is “making sure Mr Peter Obi (the party’s flag-bearer), under the banner of he Labour Party wins the next elections”. “Following the recent article published and circulated by FancyTV titled ‘Labour Party UK Chapter Executive Arms Dissolved’, this is to inform all interested parties that, the Nigeria Labour Party UK completely denies any knowledge of such development.
