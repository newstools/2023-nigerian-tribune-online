The humongous amount of money expended on road construction and rehabilitation by President Muhammadu Buhari between 2016 and 2022 is fast changing the lives of Nigerians. Perhaps one of the major undoings of President Muhammadu Buhari is his somewhat nonchalant disposition to his traducers and critics, who are attempting to label him a non-performing leader. It is only when some of his lieutenants take time out to enumerate and elucidate some of the notable achievements, they have recorded that it becomes obvious that the Nigerian leader, has indeed, written his name on the sand of time with some signature infrastructure developments undertaken by his administration. That was exactly what the former Lagos State governor and Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola, did recently when he encapsulated the array of work done by his ministry in a compendium tagged ‘PMB Administration Scorecard 2015-2023 – A Time and Economic Resource Report. Not only did this document juxtapose work done with money expended, it also went the extra mile to create an overview of the government’s income during the period under review and how resources were managed to maximise deliverables. Hundreds of roads, bridges, and houses were constructed and built during the near-eight-year tenure of President Buhari, with a budgetary allocation of N1, 584, 192, 986, 487.24. And with N964, 840, 060, 932.12 already released and N619,352,925,555.12 outstanding, very remarkable aspects of the scorecard are the details of the spillover effects of the massive government investment on infrastructure, especially, as it improves human capacity development and the consequential empowerment of the Nigerian populace. Between 2016 and 2022, a total of 8, 352.94km of roads were constructed or rehabilitated. To achieve this, a total number of 339, 955 jobs directly related to the project were created. Not only that, with tonnes of cement used totaling N1,652,190.22, diesel (N1,002,026,851.29), bitumen (N3,371,136.57), petrol (N51,716,271.07), fine aggregate sand (N18,515,735.06), coarse aggregate/gravel (N40,881,234.03) and reinforcement put at 512,505.20, several hundreds of thousands of indirect jobs were created. Though Buhari’s political opponents may choose to ignore these notable feats, the fact is, businesses, workers, artisans, and even petty traders, have all benefitted from the numerous projects spread across the country. Still, on the job creation opportunities created by the federal government expenditure on road infrastructure, a whooping 2, 990 technical staff were required for the 130 contractors’ laboratories spread across the six geo-political zones in Nigeria. There are 15 of the laboratories in the North-Central; 11 in the North-East; 45 in the North-West; 10 in the South-East; 12 in the South-South and 37 in the South-West. These laboratories departmentalised into soil laboratories, asphalt and bitumen laboratories, concrete and aggregate laboratories, steel laboratories, and chemistry laboratories, are saddled with the responsibilities of ensuring that materials used on the projects meet the specified standard and guarantee durability requirements. To really understand the effects of government infrastructure development, it is best to take a closer look at the impact analysis on the underlisted completed road rehabilitation projects: Lafia-Obi-Awe-Tunga Road, Nasarawa State; Vandeikya-Obudu Cattle Ranch Road (Phase I) Cross Rivers State; Hadejia-Nguru Road (Phase II), Kirikasama-Nguru Road, Jigawa State; Nguru-Gashua-Bayamari (Phase I) – Nguru-Gashua (phase II), Yobe State and Nguru-Gashua-Bayamari (Phase II) (Gashua-Bayamari).  There is the dualisation of Kano-Maiduguri road linking Kano-Jigawa-Bauchi-Yobe and Borno States; Completion of Gombe-Numan-Yola Road (Phase II and Gombe-Kaltungo, Gombe State; dualisation of Kano-Maiduguri road linking Kano-Jigawa-Bauchi-Yobe and Borno States (Section III Azare-Potiskum, Bauchi State; rehabilitation of section IA of Sokoto-Tambuwal -Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road (Phase I and II) in Sokoto to Kebbi/Niger States; construction of Nnenwe-Uduma-Uburu Road (Section I 26.2km and Section II: spur to Ishiagu-Mile 2 Road – 14km in Enugu/Ebonyi States; construction of Isoko Ring Road, Delta State and the rehabilitation of Efon Alaaye-Erinmo-Iwaraja Road in Ekiti/Ondo States. Collectively, these roads span 896.187km and were sources of concern for commuters, but after rehabilitation and construction, travel time was reduced by 56.20 per cent and cost, by 56.25 per cent. Therefore, a commute on 84km long Lafia-Obi-Awe-Tunga Road, Nasarawa State, which usually took about 2 hours now takes 1 hour 30 minutes and the cost is now reduced from N1, 200 to N900. It usually took 9 hours to travel through the 304km Sokoto-Tambuwal -Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road, but that was reduced by half after rehabilitation. The cost has also been reduced from N3, 500 to N2000. Similar stories go for all the roads. When these indices are spread across all the projects embarked on by the Buhari administration, it is understandable that the ripple effects are monumental and far-reaching on all Nigerian families and businesses. These specific roads created a total of 2, 124 and 3, 128 direct and indirect jobs respectively. The Sokoto-Tambuwal -Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road, phases I and II in Sokoto and Kebbi States were commissioned on Thursday, November 25, 2021, at Koko in Koko/Besse Local Government Area of Kebbi State, and this elicited reactions from residents, who are users of the roads. A resident, whose name was simply given as Garba stated: “Before the rehabilitation of the road, it took an average of three hours to drive to Jega from Koko, but that time has now been reduced to 30 minutes… We are now full of joy, and we are grateful to President Buhari.” Adding his voice, the Secretary of the Koko Trailer Drivers Union, Ibrahim Musa, noted that being a driver plying the route himself, the people are deeply touched by the project. “We thank the government greatly for the rehabilitation work and promise to give it our support 100 per cent. Before the rehabilitation of this road, it took us five hours to drive from Jega to Koko and between six and seven hours to Yauri. But it is now 1 hour 30 minutes,” he said.
