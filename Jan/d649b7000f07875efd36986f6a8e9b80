Concerns have been raised by the Global Initiative for Food Security and Preservation (GIFSEP) on the underestimation of the effects of climate change in election campaigns in 2023. Therefore, the NGO urged Nigerians to support candidates who have the plan to address climate change. This was said by Mr. David Terungwa, the Executive Director and Team Lead of the GIFSEP, an NGO, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja. In the 2023 elections, Nigerians should support politicians who are aware of the challenges surrounding climate change, according to Terungwa, a climate change expert and activist with the Climate Justice Coalition. He added that the climate crisis was one of our lifelong crises and that it was essential to the sustainability of democracy. According to him, so far, climate change is under-represented in the campaigns ahead of the 2023 general elections. “It will be a dangerous mistake if we elect climate deniers. “Climate change issues are too important to be left in the hands of deniers. This is because climate change is the defining issue of today’s world. “That is why we are calling on citizens, especially those in communities impacted by climate change, to ensure that they collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and look beyond empty campaign promises.
