In less than eight days to the deadline given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), the Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Organisation has called on Nigerians to go out enmasse and take possession of theirs as it is the only way to remove the All Progressives Congress (APC) from power. According to a statement issued on Saturday by spokesperson of the campaign, Kola Ologbondiyan, Nigerians need to have their PVCs to vote in Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, come February 25. The campaign urged citizens to note that their only chance of “expelling the insensitive, corrupt and vicious All Progressives Congress (APC), that has brought monumental anguish and pains to our country in the last seven and half years, is by collecting their PVCs and voting for Atiku Abubakar, the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to instate a purposeful leadership and commence the onerous task of rebuilding our nation.” It said the Atiku/Okowa Campaign appreciated “the tremendous support, contributions and solidarity by overwhelming majority of Nigerians towards the presidential flag bearer in furtherance of their consensus that Atiku is the candidate with the desired experience, capacity, competence, integrity and national acceptability to lead our nation out of the abyss in which she has been sunk by the APC.” It added: “All eligible Nigerians, irrespective of ethnic, religious, sectional or even political affiliations must therefore rise to the occasion, collect their PVCs, go the polls, elect Atiku Abubakar and defend their votes as a patriotic duty to redeem and rescue our nation at this critical time.
