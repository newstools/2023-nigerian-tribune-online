The hideout is located in the state’s Zurmi Local Government Area along Kaura Namoda Road. The bombardment by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) claimed the lives of around a dozen foot soldiers for Dankarami. The Air Component of Operation Hadarin Daji fired the shells. A military operative informed PRNigeria that the target was struck several times over several hours.
