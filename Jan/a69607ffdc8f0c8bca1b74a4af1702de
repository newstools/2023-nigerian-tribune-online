In a statement signed by the Managing Director of EKEDC, Dr Tinuade Sanda stated being owed over N116 billion as of December 2022. Lamenting the spate of vandalism and theft is increasingly worrisome, as vandalism in the company’s network rose to N2.5 billion, the estimated cost of cables today should be over N5 billion. “Debts alone from Ministries, Departments & Agencies, MDAs, is about N40 billion, while the total debts owed our company is over N116 billion,” she said.

The organisation is working towards a minimum of 20 hours of electricity supply, getting electricity from the power grid, as Installation is still ongoing, having done 80 out of 150. “We are moving closer and closer to our consumers. We tend to decentralize more so that our consumers can reach us.”
