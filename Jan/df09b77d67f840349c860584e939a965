The Nigerian Labour Party (LP) has said that there is no cause for alarm over its preparation for the February 25 general elections, especially deploying polling agents nationwide. The Party on Thursday said it would make its presence in 85% of the polling units in Nigeria, as it has successfully registered its polling agent with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It called on the electorates to bite for her candidate Mr Peter Obi, as it urged members of the public to ignore social media claims, that it does not have reliable footprints in the polling units because of insufficient polling agents to man the polling units and protect the interest of the party.
